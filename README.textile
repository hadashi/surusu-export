h1. Using Surusu-Export

Surusu has a usernamecookie and passwordcookie for establishing the first session. Once we have the PHPSESSIONID, we use that for all other requests.

Surusu uses the session for almost everything, due to this reason, we hit the /switchdeck.php page first to change the deck to the required one.


@ruby surusu-export.rb <username> <password> <deck>@

The above outputs to STDOUT, if you want it outputted to file, add -o file

@ruby surusu-export.rb <username> <password> <deck> -o outfile@


h1. Requirements

* ruby 1.9.1+
* scrapi gem
